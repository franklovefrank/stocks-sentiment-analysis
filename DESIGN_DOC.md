# Design Document for Stock Sentiment CLI Tool
    
## Summary 
The Stock Sentiment Analysis app allows users to explore the relationship between stock performance and public sentiment through a simple, intuitive CLI. The app utilizes the Yahoo Finance, Bluesky, and Google Cloud Natural Language APIs to combine sentiment anaylsis of tweets related to a specific stock symbol with historical data for that stock. Users can use the CLI to view sentiment analysis results, manage previous reports, and export data in various formats.

## Architecture 
### Overview 
- **CLI Interface**: Handles user input and displays results.
- **API Integrations**:
    - **Yahoo Finance API**: Fetch historical stock data.
    - **Bluesky API**: Collect recent tweets about the stock.
    - **Google Cloud Natural Language API**: Perform sentiment analysis on tweets.
- **Data Processing**: Analyze stock data and sentiment to provide insights.
- **Report Generation**: Generate and display reports combining stock metrics and sentiment analysis.
### Design Patterns
  - **Facade Pattern**: Simplifies interactions with the Yahoo Finance, Bluesky, and Google Cloud Natural Language APIs.
  - **Strategy Pattern**: Allows dynamic application of different sentiment analysis filters or strategies.
  - **Builder Pattern**: Constructs complex reports by combining data from various sources in a modular manner.
  - **Decorator Pattern**: Enhances the functionality of sentiment analysis results, such as adding context or aggregating sentiment data.
### Misc. Considerations
1. **Metrics**
    - Integrate Prometheus or another monitoring tool to track metrics like API call duration, data processing time, and request counts.
    - Example metrics:
        - API Call Duration: Measures how long it takes to fetch data from Yahoo Finance, Bluesky, and Google Cloud Natural Language.
        - Request Counts: Tracks how many times different commands or strategies are used.
2. **Testing and Benchmarking**
    - **Unit Tests**: For individual components and functions.
    - **Integration Tests**: For interactions with Yahoo Finance API, Bluesky API, and Google Cloud Natural Language API.
    - **Benchmarking**: Measure performance using Goâ€™s benchmarking tools.
3. **Scalability and Performance**
    - Optimize data fetching and processing.
    - Implement efficient algorithms and data structures for risk calculations and sentiment analysis.
    - Use concurrency to enhance performance and responsiveness.
