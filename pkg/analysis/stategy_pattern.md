### **Strategy Pattern in Detail**

#### **Usage**

The Strategy Pattern is employed to provide various ways of analyzing sentiment in tweets, enabling flexibility and adaptability based on different criteria or user preferences.

#### **Components**

1. **Context**
    
    - **Module**: `sentiment_analyzer.go`
    - **Role**: Manages the application of different sentiment analysis strategies. It holds a reference to a `SentimentStrategy` and delegates the actual sentiment analysis work to the strategy object.
2. **Strategy Interface**
    
    - **Interface**: `SentimentStrategy`
    - **Role**: Defines a common interface for all sentiment analysis strategies. This interface typically includes a method such as `Analyze(sentiments []string) (result AnalysisResult)` that all concrete strategies must implement.
3. **Concrete Strategies**
    
    - **Concrete Strategies**: Implementations of the `SentimentStrategy` interface, each providing a different approach to sentiment analysis.
        - **Example Strategy 1**: `BasicSentimentStrategy`
            - Analyzes tweets using a basic sentiment analysis algorithm that provides a simple positive, neutral, or negative sentiment score.
        - **Example Strategy 2**: `AdvancedSentimentStrategy`
            - Uses a more sophisticated algorithm or external sentiment analysis library for in-depth analysis, potentially incorporating factors like sentiment intensity or context.
        - **Example Strategy 3**: `CustomSentimentStrategy`
            - Allows for user-defined criteria or custom sentiment filters, such as specific keywords or phrases that might affect sentiment analysis.

#### **Details**

- **`sentiment_analyzer.go` Module**
    - **Context Class**: `SentimentAnalyzer`
        - **Fields**: A reference to the current `SentimentStrategy` implementation.
        - **Methods**:
            - `SetStrategy(strategy SentimentStrategy)`: Allows switching between different strategies at runtime.
            - `AnalyzeSentiments(tweets []Tweet) AnalysisResult`: Uses the current strategy to perform sentiment analysis on the given tweets.
    - **Strategy Interface**:
        - **Method**: `Analyze(tweets []Tweet) (AnalysisResult)`
            - **Purpose**: Defines a common method signature that all concrete strategies must follow, ensuring consistency in how sentiment analysis results are returned.
    - **Concrete Strategies**:
        - **BasicSentimentStrategy**:
            - **Method**: `Analyze(tweets []Tweet) (AnalysisResult)`
            - **Algorithm**: Utilizes a basic sentiment analysis algorithm, possibly leveraging predefined sentiment lexicons or keyword matching.
        - **AdvancedSentimentStrategy**:
            - **Method**: `Analyze(tweets []Tweet) (AnalysisResult)`
            - **Algorithm**: Employs advanced natural language processing techniques or machine learning models for more nuanced sentiment insights.
        - **CustomSentimentStrategy**:
            - **Method**: `Analyze(tweets []Tweet) (AnalysisResult)`
            - **Algorithm**: Configurable by user input, allowing for tailored sentiment analysis based on specific needs.

#### **Purpose**

- **Flexibility**: Users can choose or switch between different sentiment analysis methods without modifying the core sentiment analysis infrastructure. This means the `SentimentAnalyzer` class does not need to be altered when introducing new sentiment analysis strategies.
- **Maintainability**: Adding new sentiment analysis methods involves creating new strategy classes that adhere to the `SentimentStrategy` interface, promoting clean and manageable code.
- **Extensibility**: The system can easily accommodate additional sentiment analysis algorithms or filters by implementing new strategies that conform to the `SentimentStrategy` interface.

### **Example Scenario**

1. **User Input**:
    
    - A user runs the CLI and selects an option to analyze tweet sentiment using a specific strategy (e.g., advanced sentiment analysis).
2. **Execution**:
    
    - The `SentimentAnalyzer` is instantiated and configured to use the `AdvancedSentimentStrategy`.
    - Tweets related to the stock are fetched and passed to the `AnalyzeSentiments` method.
    - The `AdvancedSentimentStrategy` processes the tweets and returns a detailed sentiment analysis result.
3. **Output**:
    
    - The results are displayed to the user, showing a comprehensive sentiment breakdown based on the chosen strategy.

By incorporating the Strategy Pattern, the application ensures that different sentiment analysis methods can be seamlessly integrated and utilized, enhancing the overall flexibility and extensibility of the system.
